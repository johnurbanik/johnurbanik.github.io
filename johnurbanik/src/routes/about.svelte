  <h2>About John</h2>

  <p>I am a mission-driven and ethically conscious data scientist and engineer.
  I focus on building end-to-end systems that help humans solve difficult, open-ended problems.
  I'm particularly passionate about the development of systems that promote equity while enabling new workflows, insights and experiences.</p>
  <p>Over the course of my career, I've demonstrated strong intuition and the
  ability to dial into details while keeping hte big picture in sight. I'm adept at switching
  contexts between research, applied data science, data engineering, people management, and strategy work.</p>

  <p>As a manager and practitioner, I place a strong emphasis on exploratory data analysis, explainability,
  reliable data pipelines, and engaging stakeholders/users in development process. I value communication,
  transparency, team, and mission.</p>

  <p>My primary tech stack is the Python data stack, and methods from complexity science, causal inference, and Bayesian statistics resonte deeply with me.
  However, I'm very comfortable learning new technologies and techniques on the fly.</p>

  <p>Outside of work, I am passionate about all things music/musicology, the anthropology of food (and eating/cooking it), mycology, sustainability, and ethics.</p>

  <p>My resume is available <a href="jurbanik2020short.pdf">here</a>.</p>
